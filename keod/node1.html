INTRODUCTION</A>
</H1>

<P>
Standards are powerful means to realize interoperability among heterogeneous systems.
The process of defining them is usually as follows.
Interested stakeholders come together and decide to define a new standard for a given case. 
They build a consortium which drives this process and they create a standardization organization or they create a subgroup within an existing one.
In periodic meetings, representatives from the different stakeholders come together, communicate their particular needs, and try to find a consensus. 
If the outcome, which can be e.g a protocol, a component specification, or a vocabulary<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot358"><SUP>1</SUP></A>, is at a satisfying maturity level a specification document will be  released. 
The adopters will then create implementations of this standard. 
Possibly, they need to adapt their already existing systems.

<P>
Apparently, the overall process is quite cumbersome and long lasting. 
The more stakeholders are involved and the more existing proprietary products are affected the more is this process exacerbated.

<P>
The open and dynamic World Wide Web, on the contrary, demonstrates that with a minimalistic standard set and flexible <I>de facto</I> standards interoperability is also possible to some extend.
This is mainly enabled by focused applications and well documented specification pages.
In some cases these <I>de facto</I> standards become real standards. 
However, the main idea is that they are not created in a top-down approach as in traditional standardization activities.
Concretely, the implementation is not based on a predefined standard, but the standard is based on the adoption and the experience with existing implementations.
That makes them more practical and avoid overly engineered standards like  <I>CORBA</I>, <I>CAMEL</I> (Customised Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic), etc.
We consider this as a bottom-up approach for defining a standard.

<P>
It is worth mentioning that even within the Web context the danger of overly engineered standards is also given.
The vision of the Semantic Web for example, caused the enthusiastic creation of standards like the  <I>Web Ontology Language</I>  and the  <I>Rule Interchange Format</I>  to represent knowledge and rules.
It remains questionable if and when this standards will be really broadly adopted and if they are really practical enough to be used in various information systems.
In contrast, positive examples likes <I>Schema.org</I><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot396"><SUP>2</SUP></A> clearly demonstrate that a practice oriented approach is very effective.
The definition, implementation and the usage is integrated pragmatically and not organized sequentially.
Additionally, the open and participatory nature of the Web is leveraged by using the GitHub collaboration platform for managing feedback and contributions, versioning, publishing releases and tracking issues.

<P>
Inspired by the success of <I>Schema.org</I> we advocate to <I>revolutionize</I> approaching standardization to enable interoperability. 
In this regard, we propose a set of practices to create a common vocabulary to bridge heterogeneity among systems.
Furthermore, the endeavor to derive this methodology led to valuable insights as a by-product.
Therefore, the applied bottom-up and pragmatically best-practice oriented technique is presented in detail. 

<P>
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In  sec:bottom-up we present our approach to derive a methodology from best practices.
In  sec:vocab-analysis we present an analysis of the most widely vocabularies and we extract some useful data to be considered later for our approach.
In  sec:best-practices we propose our set of best-practices for collaborative vocabulary engineering.
A review of the state of the art is presented in sec:related-work.
We conclude this paper in sec:conclusion with shedding light on the critical aspects of this paper and provide an outlook to meaningful extensions of this work.
