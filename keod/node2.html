METHOD
</H1>

<P>
Approaching a task can be done in two different ways.
Top-down starts from the abstract and elaborates the concrete.
Whereas bottom-up starts from the concrete level and continues towards the abstract.
From a logic perspective, the former corresponds to deductive reasoning. 
It starts with known facts that are considered as premises and seeks for conclusions.
The latter, on the contrary, starts with a given set of statements and looks for premises - in other word evidences - that caused them. 

<P>
In the context of defining a methodology for vocabulary development, a top-down approach starts with the facts that are known about the expected outcome, namely the vocabulary.
From the different characteristics of it, a possible creation process is derived. 
In the next steps, a list of roles is created and a set of tools are developed or selected, which can be used within the different steps of the overall process.
In fact, most ontology engineering methodologies have been created by applying this approach.

<P>
A bottom-up approach to derive best-practices and define guidelines is supposed to start from the current state of practice and look for evidences that explain why people are doing what they are doing.
The most common activities of the most successful outcomes are than compiled as a set of best-practices. 
This is in fact the method we applied in this work.
We advocate that there is no need for just another comprehensive methodology that is designed in detail in a top-down approach.
Rather we claim that in the meanwhile there are sufficient good examples to be analyzed and learnt from.

<P>
For that reason, we empirically analyze a number of popular vocabulary and ontology development efforts.
With regard to guidelines and best-practices, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution.
Therefore, we categorize vocabulary and ontology development efforts along various dimensions such as vocabulary size, collaborator size, and expressivity.
Finally, we map the categorization to particular sets of best-practices and guidelines in order to optimally support vocabulary and ontology development efforts with a tailored sets of guidelines and best-practices.
