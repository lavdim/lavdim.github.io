CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
</H1>

<P>
In this paper, we considered creating standards through heavyweight processes within standardization organizations as the legacy approach to tackle the problem of data integration among heterogeneous systems.
Driven by the success of the Web vocabularies and the ever-increasing awareness of the importance of data, we advocate that it is now time to rethink how this problem should be addressed.
For this reason, we identified the most important vocabularies of the  Web, which we call authoritative vocabularies.
We analyzed their commonalities in terms of the key aspects documentation, internationalization, naming, structure, reuse and evaluation.
These aspect were identified as the most important ones during our own work on vocabularies like MobiVoc and SCORVoc.
Furthermore, we analyzed these authoritative vocabularies statistically in terms of used language construct.
The rationale for the whole analysis was to derive best-practices and guidelines for collaborative vocabulary development.
This bottom-up approach is in contrast to related work in the field of knowledge and ontology engineering. 
Usually, methodologies are designed in a top-down approach, without respecting the current state of practice.
In this regard, they are similar to standardization activities which tend to be over-engineered and lead to was of resources.

<P>
We deem the availability of comprehensive domain-specific vocabularies to be one of the major obstacles for a wider deployment and use of semantic technologies.
In this article, we surveyed a number of practices for collaborative vocabulary development.
Other than heavy-weight, fully fledged ontology engineering methodologies, these practices can be selected and implemented in more light-weight and agile collaboration scenarios.

<P>
Regarding future work, we aim to implement a comprehensive collaborative vocabulary authoring environment based on Git, which covers the aspects vocabulary authoring, versioning, publishing, visualization and quality assurance.
